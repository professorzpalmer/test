			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to provide a redundant visual cue for users who may not be able to discern a difference in text color.</p>
			<p>Use of Color a <a>relative luminance</a> difference of 3:1 or greater with the text around can be used to identify links and surrounding texts. To meet success criterion 1.4.1: Use of Color, use dotted lines as additional visual cue.</p>
			<p>This technique is an alternative to use solid underlines. Solid underlines might be visually distracting for pages there are a large number of links in the block of text. Links are commonly used to indicate words or phrases that are links within a paragraph or other block of text. Even using underlines on hover or keyboard focus only, they might not be used for users with touch devices.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<section class="example">
				<h3>Links with dotted underlines and colors that provides contrast ratio of 3:1 in wiki pages</h3>
				<p>The links in pages are medium-light blue (<code>#4D6BD5</code>) and the surrounding text is black (<code>#111111</code>). Links have a contrast of 3.9:1 with the surrounding text. Links also have minimal dotted underlines to reduce visually distracting in wiki pages there are a large number of links in the block of text.</p>

a {
  color: #4D6BD5;

				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<p>For each instance where color is used to convey information about text:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Check that the <a>relative luminance</a> of the color of the text differs from the relative luminance of the surrounding text by a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.</li>
					<li>Check that the link has a dotted underline.</li>
				</ol>
