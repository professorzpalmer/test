      <p> The objective of this technique is to ensure that Web pages can be
                        interpreted consistently by user agents, including assistive technology. If
                        it is ambiguous, different user agents including assistive technologies
                        could present different information to their users. Users of assistive
                        technology for example may have different information presented to them than
                        users of other mainstream user agents. The accesskey attribute in
                        HTML is required to have unique value, and if this requirement
                        is not honored, the result can be irregular or not uniquely resolvable
                        content.</p>
