      <p> The objective of this technique is to ensure that Web pages can be
                        interpreted consistently by user agents, including assistive technology. If
                        specific relationships in a Web page are ambiguous, different user agents,
                        including assistive technologies, could present different information to
                        their users. Users of assistive technology, for example, may have different
                        information presented to them than users of other mainstream user agents.
                        Some elements and attributes in markup languages are required to have unique
                        values, and if this requirement is not honored, the result can be irregular
                        or not uniquely resolvable content. </p>

                  <p> An SVG document uses <code><![CDATA[id]]></code> attributes on
                                            <code><![CDATA[title]]></code> elements (for alternative text) in
                                        order to reuse in other locations in the document. However,
                                        one of the <code><![CDATA[title]]></code> elements has an id that is
                                        also used elsewhere in the document, so the document is
                                        ambiguous. </p>

         <p> Note that for XML document types defined by a DTD, this refers to
                            attributes of type ID, IDREF or IDREFS. For XML document types defined
                            by a W3C XML Schema, this refers to elements or attributes of type ID,
                            IDREF or IDREFS. (For compatibility, the types ID, IDREF and IDREFS
                            should only be used on attributes, but using them for elements is
                            possible, according to <loc xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

                            check the corresponding mechanisms for specifying IDs and references to
                            IDs. </p>
