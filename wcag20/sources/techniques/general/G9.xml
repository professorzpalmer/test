      <p>The objective of this technique is to allow users who cannot hear to be able
            to access real-time synchronized media broadcasts. It is more difficult to create
            accurate real-time captions because there is little time to correct mistakes
            or to listen a second time or consult someone to be sure the words are
            accurately reproduced. It is also harder to simplify or paraphrase
            information if it is flowing too quickly.</p>
      <p>Real-time typing text entry techniques exist using stenographic and rapid
            typing technologies. Re-voicing speech-to-text (where a person listens to
            speech and then carefully re-voices it into a computer trained to their
            speech) is used today for telephone relay services and may be used in the
            future for captioning. Eventually speech-to-text with correction will be
            possible.</p>
