    <p>Each <a>target</a> has a unique area of at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels, except if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> The offset between targets is at least 24 CSS pixels, where the offset is measured from the farthest point of one target to the nearest point of an adjacent target;</li>
        <li><strong>Inline:</strong> The target is in a sentence or block of text;</li>
        <li><strong>Essential:</strong> A particular presentation of the target is essential to the information being conveyed;</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">This criterion is about how targets are arranged on screen, not how the code is nested.</p>
