    <p>For each step in an authentication process that relies on a <a>cognitive function test</a>, at least one other authentication method is available that does not rely on a cognitive function test or a mechanism must be available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test.</p>
    <p class="note">Examples of mechanisms include support for password entry by password managers to address the memorization cognitive function test and copy-paste to help address transcription cognitive function test.</p>
