    <p>When <a>user interface components</a> has keyboard focus, one or both the following is true:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Option 1: the focus indicator:
            <ul>
                <li>Encloses the visual presentation of the user interface component and is no thinner than 2 CSS pixels;</li>
                <li>Has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 between its pixels in the focused and unfocused states;</li>
                <li>Has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colors.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Option 2: an area of the focus indicator meets all the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Is at least as large as double the area of a 1 CSS pixel thick perimeter of the unfocused component, or is at least as large as an 8 CSS pixel thick line along the shortest side of the minimum bounding box of the unfocused component, and</li>
                <li>has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against the same pixels in the unfocused state, and </li>
                <li>has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent non-focus-indicator colors, or is no thinner than 2 CSS pixels.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Where a user interface component has active sub-components, if a sub-component receives a focus indicator, these requirements can be applied to the sub-component instead.</p>
