	<p class="change">New</p>	
   <p>A state of a <a>User Interface Component</a> when it is not available for user interaction, such as a disabled control in HTML. An inactive user interface component is present but not currently operable using standard input mechanisms such as keyboard, pointer, or assistive technology.</p>
<p class="note">An example inactive user interface component is a submit button at the bottom of a form which is present but cannot be activated until all the required fields in the form are completed.</p>   				
<p class="note">An inactive user interface component should not be confused with controls which are not currently selected. For example in a tabbed interface, the tabs which are not selected are not regarded as inactive user interface components - they may be interacted with by the user to switch tabs in the tabbed interface, and therefore do not meet the definition of inactive.</p>
  <p class="note>A read-only text input field which is focusable using standard input mechanisms is considered to be active.</p>
