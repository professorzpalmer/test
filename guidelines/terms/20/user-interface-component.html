<dd>
   
   <p>a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct
      function
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Multiple user interface components may be implemented as a single programmatic element.
      Components here is not tied to programming techniques, but rather to what the user
      perceives as separate controls.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">User interface components include form elements and links as well as components generated
      by scripts.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">What is meant by "component" or "user interface component" here is also sometimes
      called "user interface element".
   </p>

   <p class="note">User interface components are "inactive" when they are not available for user interaction (e.g., a disabled control in HTML). An inactive user interface component is visible but not currently operable. An example would be a submit button at the bottom of a form that is visible but cannot be activated until all the required fields in the form are completed. This should not be confused with user interface controls which are not currently "selected". For example, in a tabbed interface, the tabs which colloquially would be referred to as not being "active" are <em>not</em> "inactive user interface components" - as long as they aren't disabled completely, they can be interacted with by the user (to switch tabs in the tabbed interface), and therefore aren't "inactive". More accurately, these tabs are merely "not selected".</p>
   
   <p class="example">An applet has a "control" that can be used to move through content by line or page
      or random access. Since each of these would need to have a name and be settable independently,
      they would each be a "user interface component."
