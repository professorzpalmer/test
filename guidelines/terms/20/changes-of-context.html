<dt><dfn data-lt="change of context">changes of context</dfn></dt>
<dd>
   <p>major changes in either the content of the current <a>Web page</a>, or a complete change of where the user is currently focused, that, if made without user awareness, can disorient users
   </p>
   
   <p>Changes in context include changes of:</p>
   
   <ol>
      
      <li><a>user agent</a> (if a separate user agent, such as an external viewer programme, is opened);
      </li>
      
      <li><a>viewport</a> (if a new window is opened);
      </li>
      
      <li>focus (if the user's focus is moved to a different part of the current Web page);</li>
      
      <li><a>content</a> that changes the meaning of the <a>Web page</a>
      </li>
      
   </ol>
   
   <p class="note">A change of content is not always a change of context. Changes in content, such as
      an expanding outline, dynamic menu, or a tab control do not necessarily change the
      context, unless they also change one of the above (e.g., focus).
   </p>
   
   <p class="example">Opening a new window, moving focus to a different component, going to a new page (including
      anything that would look to a user as if they had moved to a new page) or significantly
      re-arranging the content of a page are examples of changes of context.
