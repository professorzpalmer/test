        <h2>Focus Appearance (Enhanced) Success Criteria text</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <h4>Focus Appearance (Enhanced)</h4>
    
            <p>When <a>user interface components</a> has keyboard focus, one or both the following is true:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Option 1: the focus indicator:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Encloses the visual presentation of the user interface component;</li>
                        <li>Has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 between its pixels in the focused and unfocused states;</li>
                        <li>Has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Option 2: an area of the focus indicator meets all the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is at least as large as double the area of a 1 CSS pixel thick perimeter of the unfocused component, or is at least as large as an 8 CSS pixel thick line along the shortest side of the minimum bounding box of the unfocused component, and</li>
                        <li>has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against the same pixels in the unfocused state, and </li>
                        <li>has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent non-focus-indicator colors, or is no thinner than 2 CSS pixels.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Where a user interface component has active sub-components, if a sub-component receives a focus indicator, these requirements can be applied to the sub-component instead.</p>

        <h2>Intent of Focus Appearance (Enhanced)</h2>


        <p>The purpose of this Success Criterion is to ensure a keyboard focus indicator is highly visible. This criterion is closely related to <a href="./focus-appearance-minimum.html">Success Criterion 2.4.11 Focus Appearance (Minimum)</a> and defines a higher level of visibility for the focus indicator.</p>

        <p>In relation to Focus Visible (enhanced) this criterion:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expands the minimum area to 2 CSS pixels around the perimeter.</li>
            <li>Increases the change of contrast to 4.5:1.</li>
            <li>Does not allow for any part of the focus indicator to be obscured by other, author-created content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The other aspects of the Success Criterion are the same as Focus Visible (Minimum).</p>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>Benefits of Focus Appearance (Enhanced)</h2>
      <p>The benefits of this Success Criterion are similar to Focus Appearance (Minimum).</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Sighted keyboard users can visually determine which component will be interacted with using keyboard operations.</li>
         <li>People with low vision are better able to follow a highly visible focus indicator.</li>
         <li>People with attention limitations, short term memory limitations, or limitations in executive processes benefit by being able to discover where the focus is located.</li>
      </ul>

   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Focus Visible</h2>
      <p>The examples of this Success Criterion are similar to Focus Appearance (Minimum).</p>
      <ul>
         <li>When links receive focus, an outline is displayed around the link that contrasts with the background adjacent to the link.</li>
         <li>When buttons receive focus, an outline is displayed within the button (around the text) that contrasts with the buttonâ€™s background.</li>
         <li>When text fields receive focus, an outline is displayed around the field, indicating that the input has focus.</li>  
         <li>When radio buttons receive focus, an outline is displayed around the control, indicating that the input has focus.</li>        
      </ul>
