		<h1>DRAFT WCAG2ICT Task Force Work Statement</h1>
		<p>The WCAG2ICT Task Force is a task force of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG)</a>. It assists this Working Group with the work identified below.</p>
		<section id="status">
			<h2>Status</h2>
			<p>This work statement was <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2022AprJun/0280.html">accepted by the AG WG on 22 June 2022</a>. The task force is active.</p>
			<p>NOTE: This work is mentioned in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/12/ag-charter#ig-other-deliverables">Other Deliverables section of the current AG WG Charter.</a>  The continuation of the work is also included in the proposed AG WG Charter.</p>

			<h2>Objective</h2>
			<p>The objective of the WCAG2ICT Task Force is to develop documentation describing how WCAG 2.x and its principles, guidelines, and success criteria could apply to non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (ICT). </p>
			<p>This Task Force was formed to update the 2013 “<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/">Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT)</a>” working group Note published on 5 September 2013. Updates are needed to include new guidelines and success criteria added in the WCAG 2.1 Recommendation as well as new requirements added in WCAG 2.2. WCAG2ICT was developed to describe how to apply WCAG 2.0 and its principles, guidelines, and success criteria to non-web ICT (Information and Communications Technology) that are not web content. WCAG2ICT also plans to add new content that identifies problematic WCAG provisions when applied to non-Web ICT.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="scope">
			<h2>Scope of Work</h2>
			<p>The work of the task force includes: </p>
		</section>
		<ul>
			<li>Determining how to apply each of the new WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.2 (hereafter called “WCAG 2.x”) guidelines and Levels A, AA, and AAA success criteria to non-Web ICT; this includes provision of additional details for application to closed product software and where applying individual criteria might be difficult and why; and</li>
			<li>Producing an updated Working Group Note (a form of W3C Technical Report)—following the W3C process under the coordination, review, and approval of the AG WG—that describes: <ul>
					<li>how each of the new WCAG 2.x A, AA, and AAA success criteria could apply to non-Web ICT,</li>
					<li>how each of the new WCAG 2.x guidelines could apply to non-Web ICT,</li>
					<li>clarification of challenges of applying particular WCAG 2.x success criteria to non-web technologies, including closed product software,</li>
					<li>address challenges in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Awcag2ict">WCAG open issues labeled WCAG2ICT</a>.</li>
				</ul></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Explicitly out of scope for the WCAG2ICT Task Force work:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Proposing changes to WCAG 2.x</li>
			<li>Developing techniques or interpretations of WCAG 2.x for implementing WCAG 2.x in Web technologies</li>
			<li>Developing any specific, sufficient techniques, including platform-specific techniques, for implementing WCAG 2.x in non-Web ICT, though examples may be in scope</li>
			<li>Determining whether WCAG provisions <i>should be</i> applied to non-web content</li>
			<li>Developing a normative standard or any normative requirements</li>
		</ul>
		<section id="approach">
			<h2>Approach</h2>
			<p>WCAG2ICT is a Task Force of the AG WG, which has oversight over the Task Force to ensure accurate interpretation and representation of WCAG 2.x. The AG WG decision process will apply within the group. We will also have an AG WG co-chair participate regularly to ensure the work is taken to the AG WG for review as the work progresses.</p> 
			<p>The primary effort of this Task Force will be describing how to interpret WCAG 2.x and its principles, guidelines, success criteria and conformance requirements when applying them to non-web ICT; and evaluating what WCAG Conformance means in the context of non-Web ICT. The resulting Working Group Note will include a discussion of the application of each of the criteria in WCAG 2.x to non-Web ICT, including their interface components and platforms, and the extent to which <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance">WCAG Conformance</a> is meaningful to non-Web ICT.</p>
			<p>In order to efficiently develop the core Working Group Note, the work may be broken down into sub-groups if and as necessary, under the coordination of the Task Force facilitator(s) and following established AG WG procedures for sub-groups.</p>
			<p>The work will be focused in stages to ensure WCAG2ICT content is available in time for use in upcoming updates to regulations and standards (like the EN 301 549) that apply WCAG to non-web technology. This means prioritizing Level A and AA criteria and known issues in the existing Note. WCAG2ICT could potentially need to be published before addressing Level AAA due to regulatory schedule needs. If publication is needed prior to addressing Level AAA criteria, another update to the WCAG2ICT Note may be necessary.</p>
			<p>The work will be carried out through a series of document drafts, all publicly visible, with opportunities for public comment through publicly available comment lists. In particular, key stakeholders such as developers, evaluators, accessibility experts, researchers, procurement experts, and end users will be regularly involved in the development process. Key participants will be drawn from people with expertise not only in Web technologies, but also those with platform-specific accessibility expertise, including people involved in the development of accessibility frameworks, accessible platforms, accessible user interface components, and accessible software (including products closed to assistive technology) for a broad variety of computing environments.</p>
